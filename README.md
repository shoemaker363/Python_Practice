This is project I wanted to do to help myself learn python, and to help my fellow classmates learn if they wished to.
Anyone is welcome to clone if they feel like practicing/learning python.

This was all coded in VSCode, I have current settings and extensions added to repository to try and make viewing/using this repository easier.

You will need to add the "#" and "@" to settings.json for better comments. (I needed more comment colors, lol.)
    It is the last 2 entry in the better comments section of the Current_settings_VScode.txt file. (Starts on line 85)

Could not have done this without my friend and fellow classmate "ZekeMer", Who also has a github if you want to check it out.

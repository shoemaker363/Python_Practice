#TODO   Making a tip calculator with only 2 decimal places.
#TODO   Your goal is to make A calculator that takes variables from user and calculates the result.

#!      Bill Amount.
#!      Tip Amount.
#!      Number of people splitting the bill. 

#!      Total needs to be amount per person.

#?      My solution will start on line 100 for you to reference if you need to.
























































































#print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

# bill = float(input("What was the total for the bill? $"))
# tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, 15, 20, 25? "))
# split = int(input("How many people are splitting the bill? "))

# percent_of_tip = tip / 100
# tip_total = bill * percent_of_tip

# bill_total = bill + tip_total

# bill_per_person = bill_total / split
# total = round(bill_per_person, 2)


# print(f"The total amount per person is: ${total}.")
